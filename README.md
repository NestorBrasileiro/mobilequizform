# mobile quiz form

// Mobile form for quiz or content that you need to change to mobile.

This web format can be used to improve projects that you doesn't have a mobile first webpage.
I'm completely beginner in web development and I did this litle and simple page to increase my capacity of web development.

// Usage

You can use this format of page whatever number of pages you have, only you need to configure the buttons.

// Credits

The model of "modal credits" is based only on my experience and you can edit all that you want.

// Validator of Quiz and questions.

In that model you need to specify the content of answer and convert this to Js code, there you could edit the answers and see the results by yourself.
